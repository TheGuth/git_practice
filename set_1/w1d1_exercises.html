// 1) Write a statement which logs 'Hi, my name is Chris and I'm 29 years old' to the console (you can lie about your age).


// 2) Wrap the statement in a function called whoAmI and call that function

}

// 3) Change the hard coded string into a parameters, name and age

// 4) Create a variable named yearOfBirth and calculate the year based on age (ex 2016 - age). Then add another console.log statement that outputs I was born in [insert yearOfBirth].

// 5) Move the year of birth calculation into a new function.
