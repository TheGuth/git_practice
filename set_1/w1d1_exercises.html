// 1) Write a statement which logs 'Hi, my name is Chris and I'm 29 years old' to the console (you can lie about your age).


// 2) Wrap the statement in a function called whoAmI and call that function
var myName = "Chris";
var myAge = 10;
var currentDate = new Date().getFullYear();


var yearOfBirth = function(age){
  return currentDate - age;
};

var callName = function(){
  if (yearOfBirth(myAge) > currentDate){
    throw "error"
  } else {
    console.log("Hi, my name is "+ myName + " and I'm " + myAge);
    console.log("I was born in " + yearOfBirth(myAge));
  }
}

try {
   callName();
}
catch (e) { // non-standard
  console.log("Hi, I'm from the future!");
}




// 3) Change the hard coded string into a parameters, name and age

// 4) Create a variable named yearOfBirth and calculate the year based on age (ex 2016 - age). Then add another console.log statement that outputs I was born in [insert yearOfBirth].

// 5) Move the year of birth calculation into a new function.

// 6) What happens if you enter a negative age? Add a try/catch
